Parental divorce is
a life-changing event

00:00:08.306 --> 00:00:11.676 A:middle
that can require families
to make big adjustments.

00:00:11.676 --> 00:00:14.466 A:middle
Both parents and children
can struggle to settle

00:00:14.466 --> 00:00:18.286 A:middle
into new circumstances, and
many factors can affect how well

00:00:18.286 --> 00:00:20.186 A:middle
families navigate
the transition.

00:00:20.736 --> 00:00:22.086 A:middle
How much conflict is there

00:00:22.086 --> 00:00:24.096 A:middle
between parents after
the divorce?

00:00:24.626 --> 00:00:26.926 A:middle
How important is it that
the child spend time

00:00:26.926 --> 00:00:30.926 A:middle
with each parent, and how much
time is the right amount now

00:00:30.926 --> 00:00:32.436 A:middle
that there are two households?

00:00:32.876 --> 00:00:35.336 A:middle
Do other changes,
like moving homes

00:00:35.476 --> 00:00:37.656 A:middle
or changing schools,
affect children?

00:00:38.286 --> 00:00:41.406 A:middle
Review the research that can
be applied to this case under

00:00:41.556 --> 00:00:44.236 A:middle
"Consult the Research"

00:00:44.236 --> 00:00:47.656 A:middle
into the Mason family's
current circumstances while you

"Investigate the Evidence".

00:00:49.226 --> 00:00:53.066 A:middle
After you've gathered all the
information, make a decision

00:00:53.066 --> 00:00:55.546 A:middle
about what you think the
best course of action is

00:00:55.546 --> 00:00:57.846 A:middle
for the Masons, giving
a rationale

00:00:57.846 --> 00:00:59.466 A:middle
for your thinking process.
