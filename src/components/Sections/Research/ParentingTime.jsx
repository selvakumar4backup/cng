            <li>One factor to consider for children&#8217;s post-divorce adjustment is the division of parenting time. Lack of time with a parent who no longer lives with the child &#8211; often the father &#8211; puts a child at risk for a number of struggles, such as increased hostility, psychological disorders, and health problems (Baude et al., 2016; Fabricius &#38; Luecken, 2007).</li>
            <li>Current research has found that the relationship between fathers and their children gets better the more parenting time fathers have up to 50&#37;, whereas the relationship between the child and their mother is not harmed when fathers spend up to the 50&#37; time limit with the child (Fabricius et al., 2012; Vrolijk &#38; Keizer, 2021).</li>
            <li>Parents with shared physical custody have kids that are better adjusted than those that spend a minimal amount of time with one parent and live primarily with the other parent (whether that&#8217;s mother or father), regardless of the amount of conflict between the parents (Bastaits &#38; Pasteels, 2019; Nielsen, 2018).</li>
